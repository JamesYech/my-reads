## Expectations of App

Books on the main screen will be displayed/updated in real-time.
Books on the main screen will have their current shelf disabled on the drop down menu.
Books on the main screen will maintain their shelf between refreshes of the browser.

Books on the search screen will have their current shelf disabled in the drop down menu if they are already in the collection.
Search criteria will not cause an error.  If no books are returned a message stating as such will be displayed.

Books on both screens will display cover art, full title, and all authors.  If any of these are missing they will be caught and an error will not be thrown.

Navigation will work properly allowing user to move from to and from each screen as expected when using a web browser.
